This repo contains a few different Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the different Machine Learning Algorithms vs Deep Learning using Tensorflow Keras. Output from Keras is stored and visualized in Tensorboard.

[ML vs DL (Classification - Credit Card Payments)](https://github.com/sergani/ml-vs-dl/blob/main/ML%20vs%20DL%20(Classification%20-%20Credit%20Card%20Payments).ipynb) uses the credit cards payment dataset available [here](https://github.com/sergani/training-datasets/tree/main/credit%20card%20dataset).

[ML vs DL (Classification - Telco Churn)](https://github.com/sergani/ml-vs-dl/blob/main/ML%20vs%20DL%20(Classification%20-%20Telco%20Churn).ipynb) uses the telco customers churn dataset available [here](https://github.com/sergani/training-datasets/blob/main/telco%20churn.zip).

[ML vs DL (Classification - Titanic)](https://github.com/sergani/ml-vs-dl/blob/main/ML%20vs%20DL%20(Classification%20-%20Titanic).ipynb) uses the titanic dataset available [here](https://github.com/sergani/training-datasets/blob/main/titanic.csv).

[ML vs DL (Regression - Airline Ticket Prices)](https://github.com/sergani/ml-vs-dl/blob/main/ML%20vs%20DL%20(Regression%20-%20Airline%20Ticket%20Prices).ipynb) uses the titanic dataset available [here](https://github.com/sergani/training-datasets/blob/main/airline%20ticket%20prices.csv).
